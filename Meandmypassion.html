            <td>Hello, my name is Judy. I am studying Master of computing in my second semester. I have one year of
                experience
                working as team member in a non-profit environment organization in US. By finishing my study in US, I
                decided to
                achieve different area knowledge in Australia. My past-experience has helped me broaden my vision
                towards
                creative and strategic thinking. In my spare time, I am passionate about baking, which is the best way
                to relax
                when I have overwhelming pressure on study.</td>

            <td>In my free time, I have three passions that bring me immense joy. First and foremost, baking is my
                biggest love. I relish the process of taking ingredients and turning them into delectable treats, and I
                thoroughly enjoy troubleshooting any technical challenges that arise during the baking process.
                Secondly, I have a passion for capturing and expressing my thoughts through both video and written
                content, which I enjoy sharing on social media. Lastly, my favorite physical activity is playing tennis,
                and I was even a key member of my university's tennis club. These three passions bring out the best in
                me and allow me to express myself creatively while also staying active and engaged.</td>
